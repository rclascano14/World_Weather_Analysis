# World_Weather_Analysis
`Plotting the relationship between latitude and weather for cities around the world using Python, Pandas, and APIs.`

### Resources
- Python v3.7.6, Dependencies: Pandas, CitiPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, API's, JSON
- Jupyter Notebook: Weather_Database.ipynb, Vacation_Search.ipynb, Vacation_Itinerary.ipynb
- CSV Files: Weather_Database.csv, WeatherPy_vacation.csv
## Overview of Project
Throughout this module, I have been utilizing API's to draw upon weather data and create complex data visualizations for the purpose of creating a PlanMyTrip app. This Assignment requires that I build further upon this app by adding a weather description to the weather data that has already been aquired. They also suggest that I utilize input statements, that will filter data and allow customers to find suitable hotels with suitable climates. To this end, I put together 4 select cities and created a travel itinerary out of them. With this itinerary, I then employed the Google Maps Directions API to create a custom travel route for these potential customers. All of this is to highlight the efficacy of my app and to create a convenient and functioning way to plan trips.
## List of Destinations
Shown below is the Google Map of all possible locations for potential travelers. With this selection at hand, I chose 4 cities with the same starting and ending, with the express purpose of creating a travel route out of them.
- start_city == "Boffa"
- end_city == "Boffa"
- city1 == "San-Pedro"
- city2 == "Harper"
- city3 == "Mattru"

## Travel Itinerary
Illustrated below is the map markers for the 4 selected cities in West Africa. As aforementioned, the travel route starts in Boffa, then travels down to San-Predro, then to Harper, then to Mattru and at last, it ends once again in Boffa.
